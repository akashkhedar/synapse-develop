The Synapse ML Backend (https://github.com/Synapse/synapse-ml-backend/) is an SDK that lets you wrap your machine learning code and turn it into a web server. The web server can be connected to a running Synapse instance to automate labeling tasks. 

You can find ML backend examples for Synapse studio here:

This folder (synapse/synapse/ml) is an API that interacts with Synapse ML Backends.
