In the critical world of medical AI, precision isn't just a requirement—it's a lifeline. But for years, teams have been forced to choose between clunky legacy software and generic tools that don't understand healthcare.

Introducing Synapse, built by Team Heretics. The comprehensive data operations platform engineered specifically for the next generation of HealthTech AI."

"It starts here, at the Command Center. As a Project Manager, you need complete visibility. Synapse provides real-time insights into your data pipeline at a glance. Track progress, monitor quality, and manage team performance effortlessly."
0:50 - 1:20	The Client: Setup	Client	Screen Record: Click "Create Project". Show the intuitive wizard. Select "Medical Imaging" -> "DICOM Segmentation". Upload a dataset of DICOM files. Configure a custom labeling interface with just a few clicks.	"Setting up a new study is seamless. Whether you're dealing with DICOMs for radiology or pathology slides, Synapse handles the complexity.

Simply define your schema, import your dataset, and your project is live. Our proprietary ingestion engine processes medical formats natively, ensuring no metadata is lost.

Now, let's look at the workhorse of the platform. Logging in as an Annotator, we enter the specialized labeling interface.

Synapse brings a diagnostic-grade DICOM viewer directly to the browser. Experience zero-latency scrolling, precise windowing and leveling, and high-fidelity rendering. No plugins, no downloads.

"Speed is critical, but not at the cost of accuracy. This is where our Active Learning engine shines.

Synapse doesn't just store data; it learns from it. With integrated AI assistance, annotators receive pre-labeled suggestions from your models. They simply validate and correct, cutting annotation time by up to 80% and reducing human fatigue."

"Quality assurance is built-in, not bolted on.

Experts and Radiologists can review completed tasks in a dedicated workflow. They can leave precise, slice-specific comments, compare versions, and send tasks back for correction. This loop ensures that only Gold Standard data makes it to your training set."

"As your project scales, Synapse scales with you. Deep dive into granular analytics to identify bottlenecks or class imbalances.

And when you're ready, exporting your dataset is a single click away, formatted perfectly for popular frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow."

"From raw data to life-saving models, Synapse connects your entire AI lifecycle.

Secure. Scalable. Specialized.

This is Synapse. Accelerate your Medical AI.
